# üìà Quantum-Inspired Stock Market Simulator (Classic Version)

This Streamlit app simulates stock market behavior using classic randomness. It‚Äôs designed to mimic the volatile, unpredictable nature of stock prices ‚Äî perfect for learning basic market dynamics and randomness-based simulations.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This version **does not use Qiskit or real quantum randomness** ‚Äî it's built with Python‚Äôs `random` module for easier setup and portability.
